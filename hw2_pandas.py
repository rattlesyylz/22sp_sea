This program implements of the function of hw2.
The pokemon dataset stores some imagined data about a playerâ€™s pokemon.
This program focuses on providing descriptive statistics for summarizing
the pokemon dataset, such as computing the mean or count of a certain column.
Each function is solved with pandas.
