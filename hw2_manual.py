This program implements of the function of hw2.
The pokemon dataset stores some imagined data about a playerâ€™s pokemon.
This program focuses on providing descriptive statistics
for summarizing the pokemon dataset, such as computing the mean
or count of a certain column.
Each function is solved without pandas.
